Dear Professor Dana C. Ernst,

I would like to invite you to spend the spring of 2023, or a smaller
part of it, as a visiting academic at the University of Iceland. Our
department would provide office space and access to computing
facilities. You would also have the option of teaching a mathematics
course while visiting us here in Iceland.

I hope that you will accept this offer and I look forward to a
profitable research association with you.

Yours sincerely,\medskip\\
