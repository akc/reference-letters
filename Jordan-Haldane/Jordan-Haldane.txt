# For how long and in what capacity have you known the applicant?

I was Jordan's advisor for his individual project. This lasted from Oct
2011 to April 2012. 

# What is your assessment of the applicant's intellectual ability?

Jordan is a good communicator; he has a good command of language. He is good
at planing. His abstract thinking is a bit weaker.

# Is the applicant suitably motivated towards and suitable for
  postgraduate study?

Yes, he is.

# What do you consider to be the applicant's principal strengths and
  weaknesses?

Jordan's principal strengths are that he is diligent and independent. He
made my work as advisor exceptionally easy. Jordan planned the project,
booked meetings, set deadlines, etc, without me having to do
anything. He had no problems meeting the deadlines even-though I made it
harder for him by modifying the specification of his project a few
times. He also has a positive outlook and is easy to communicate
with. Jordan also appears to be very comfortable programming.

With regard to weaknesses, I think he sets his goals a bit low
sometimes; his project could have been more ambitious. Also, he
struggles with the more theoretical parts of computer science, such as
algorithms and their underpinnings. I would not recommend him for
mathematical work.
