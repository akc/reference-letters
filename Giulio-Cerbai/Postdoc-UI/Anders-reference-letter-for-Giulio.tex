{\bf Recommendation for Giulio Cerbai}\hfill 26 November 2020
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

I know Giulio quite well. We met at a conference in 2018 and we have
been working together on various projects since then. Giulio is
currently a PhD student at University of Florence and he is expected to
graduate in the spring of 2021. I visited Florence in late 2018 to work
with Giulio and Luca Ferrari (Giulio's advisor). Giulio, conversely,
came to work with me at UI for a month in 2019.

I am currently working with Giulio on a couple of research projects. One
is about sorting algorithms and permutation patterns. The other is about
endo\-functions and so called transport theorems. Giulio is the driving
force in both projects.

Say something about publications, talks, etc.

Giulio still writing skills could be furhter improved.

In summary, my experience of interacting with Giulio could not be more
positive; he's curious, intelligent and a very mature and independent
worker for such an early stage in his career. He easily handles big work
loads; in fact, he seems to thrive under pressure.  Giulio would be a
fantastic addition to the University of Iceland. His application has my
unreserved and enthusiastic support.
