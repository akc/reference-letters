{\bf Recommendation for Giulio Cerbai}\hfill 25 November 2020
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

I know Giulio very well. I first met at a conference in ??? and I've
been working with him on various projects since then. He's currently an
PhD student at University of Florence and is expected to graduate in the
spring of 2021.

% I'm currently working with Bjarki on a project related to his MSc
% thesis. This is a project about formalizing---in such detail as to be
% machine verifiable---the so called translation method in enumerative
% combinatorics, which is a way to semi-automatically translate an
% algebraic proof of equinumeracy to a bijective proof of the same fact.

% Bjarki is an exceptional student and programmer. During his
% undergraduate studies at Reykjavik University he was on the dean's list
% every semester he was eligible, and graduated with the highest GPA. He
% was then awarded the Alan Turing Scholarship, a full scholarship given
% to strong students applying for master's studies at Reykjavik
% University. Bjarki is the coauthor of several research papers.  His
% papers have been presented at the Joint Mathematics Meetings (2015), the
% 16th Italian Conference on Theoretical Computer Science, the Permutation
% Patterns Conference (2015 and 2016), and at the MIT Combinatorics
% Seminar (2013).

% Bjarki is a very successful competitive programmer (Iceland's best). He
% has competed in numerous contests in different parts of the world and he
% has organized some contests as well. Bjarki has also held a course
% (T-414-ÁFLV) about competitive programming at Reykjavik University.

% Given that Bjarki's background is mostly in computer science and
% discrete mathematics he is lacking some of the width (in terms of
% different branches of mathematics) that a pure mathematics education
% would have given him, but this hasn't presented any problems so far, and
% I don't anticipate it will, as Bjarki is very quick and eager to learn.

% In summary, my experience of interacting with Bjarki couldn't be more
% positive; he's curious, intelligent and a very mature and independent
% worker for such an early stage in his career. He easily handles big work
% loads; in fact, he seems to thrive under pressure.  Bjarki would be a
% fantastic addition to the PhD program at the University of Iceland. His
% application has my unreserved and enthusiastic support.
