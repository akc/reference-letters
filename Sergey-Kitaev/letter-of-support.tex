{\bf In support of Sergey Kitaev's application}

% You are excited about the project as it is timely, interesting, will
% have many academic beneficiaries, etc :) and that you would be willing
% to host me, my postdoc (to be recruited), and any other project
% partners, and also travel yourself for research visits related to the
% project.

The enumeration of maps was pioneered by Tutte in the 1960s and it has
since then been a thriving and important area of research. As detailed
in Kitaev's case for support he has made several significant
contributions in this area and I have no doubt that given the
opportunity he will produce many more interesting results. In
addition to Kitaev's proven track record as a researcher he is also an
excellent leader and administrator who always finds a way to get
things done.

I have worked with Kitaev on a number of projects and together we have
developed software that enable us to quickly come up with plausible
conjectures and test different hypotheses. This has proven to be an
essential tool in the past and I believe it is ideally suited for
the projects Kitaev is proposing. I find that to strengthen the
connection between the study permutation patterns and map enumeration
is a particularly timely and interesting part of Kitaev's plan.

It is my intention to work with Kitaev and the other project partners
on this project. I would be happy to travel to facilitate the research
as well as host Kitaev (and other project partners)


Yours sincerely,\medskip\\
