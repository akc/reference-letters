{\bf Reference for Arnar Ágúst Kristjánsson}
\bigskip

I've known Arnar since 2020 and I've had the privilege of his attendance
in three courses: Algebra (group and ring theory), Set Theory and Metric
Spaces, and Enumerative Combinatorics.  These are demanding courses aimed
at mathematics majors. The Enumerative Combinatorics course is
particularly challenging. It is largely about combinatorial species, a
category theory approach to combinatorics, which is usually a
postgraduate level topic.

Arnar is a truly remarkable student, he is hard working; super sharp;
excellent at writing; well-spoken; focused; and when it comes to marks
in my courses, he has a perfect score. I'm convinced that he will go on
to become a very accomplished mathematician in his own right, if he is
so inclined.

Arnar has also served as student representative on the meetings of the
Mathematics department at the University of Iceland, and his input to
those meetings has been constructive and appreciated by the staff.

In 2021 and 2022 Arnar was my teaching assistant in the Algebra course.
He was responsible for tutorials and marking of assignments. As always,
he accomplished his tasks at the highest standard, and made my life very
easy. Currently he is assisting me in the Set Theory and Metric Spaces
course.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that Arnar is one of Iceland's
finest students---a fact that is also witnessed by him receiving the Sigurður
Helgason award---and his application has my unreserved support.
