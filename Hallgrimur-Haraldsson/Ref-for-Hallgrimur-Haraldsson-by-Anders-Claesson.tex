{\bf Reference for Hallgrímur Haraldsson}
\bigskip

I've known Hallgrímur for three years. He has taken two of my courses:
Algebra (group and ring theory) in 2022 and Set Theory and Metric Spaces
in 2023. These are demanding courses aimed at mathematics majors.

Hallgrímur is hard working and focused, and when it comes to marks in my
courses he has a nearly perfect score. For being at such an early stage
in his career he is also mature as a mathematician. I'm convinced that
he will go on to become an accomplished mathematician in his own right,
if he continues on this path.

This spring, Hallgrímur was my teaching assistant in the Set Theory and
Metric Spaces course. He was responsible for tutorials and marking of
assignments. He organized the tutorials himself, making my work very
easy. He also dared to experiment with different teaching methods.

Hallgrímur is one of Iceland's finest students---a fact that is also
witnessed by him receiving the Sigurður Helgason award---and his
application thas my unreserved support.
