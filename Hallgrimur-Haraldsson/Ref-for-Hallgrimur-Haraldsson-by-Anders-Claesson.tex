{\bf Reference for Hallgrímur Haraldsson}
\bigskip

I've known Hallgrímur for several years. He has taken two of my courses:
{\em Algebra} (group and ring theory) in 2022 and {\em Set Theory and Metric Spaces}
in 2023. These are demanding courses aimed at mathematics majors.
Hallgrímur is hard working and focused, and when it comes to marks in
these two courses he has a nearly perfect score. In addition,
Hallgrímur took the {\em Enumerative Combinatorics} course in 2023, a
course that I've developed but was taught by a postdoctoral researcher
working with me. This
course is particularly challenging as it is largely about combinatorial
species, a category theory approach to enumerative combinatorics, which
is usually a postgraduate level topic. Hallgrímur had a perfect score on
this course as well.


In the spring of 2024, Hallgrímur was my teaching assistant in the Set Theory and
Metric Spaces course. He was responsible for tutorials and marking of
assignments. He organized the tutorials himself, making my work very
easy, and he was appreciated by the students. He also dared to
experiment with different teaching methods.

For being at such an early stage in his career Hallgrímur is mature as a
mathematician and I'm convinced that he will go on to become an
accomplished mathematician in his own right, if he continues on this
path.

In sum, Hallgrímur is one of Iceland's finest students---a fact that is
also witnessed by him receiving the Sigurður Helgason award---and his
application thas my unreserved support.
