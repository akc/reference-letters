{\bf Reference for Hallgrímur Haraldsson}
\bigskip

I've known Hallgrímur since 2020 and I've had the privilege of his attendance
in three courses: Algebra (group and ring theory), Set Theory and Metric
Spaces, and Enumerative Combinatorics.  These are demanding courses aimed
at mathematics majors. The Enumerative Combinatorics course is
particularly challenging; it is largely about combinatorial species, a
category theory approach to combinatorics, which is usually a
postgraduate level topic.

Hallgrímur is an excellent student, he is hard working; focused;
a skillful writer; well-spoken; and when it comes to marks
in my courses, he has a perfect score. For being at such an early stage
in his career he is also remarkably mature as a mathematician. I'm
convinced that he will go on to become an accomplished
mathematician in his own right, if he is so inclined.

Hallgrímur has served as student representative on the meetings of the
Mathematics department at the University of Iceland, and his input to
those meetings has been constructive and appreciated by the staff.

In 2021 and 2022 Hallgrímur was my teaching assistant in the Algebra course.
He was responsible for tutorials and marking of assignments. As always,
he accomplished his tasks at the highest standard. He also organized the
tutorials himself, making my work very easy. Currently he is assisting
me in the Set Theory and Metric Spaces course.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that Hallgrímur is one of Iceland's
finest students---a fact that is also witnessed by him receiving the
Sigurður Helgason award---and his application to the University of
Amsterdam has my unreserved support.
