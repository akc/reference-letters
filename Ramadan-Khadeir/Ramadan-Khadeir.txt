# For how long and in what capacity have you known the applicant?

I was Ramadan's advisor for his individual project. This lasted from Oct
2011 to May 2012.

# What is your assessment of the applicant's intellectual ability?

Ramadan has excellent intellectual abilities. He is the best student
I've met at strathclyde so far. Despite having rather poor background in
mathematics he was able to read and understand research papers I
assigned him.

# Is the applicant suitably motivated towards and suitable for
  postgraduate study?

He most certainly is.

# What do you consider to be the applicant's principal strengths and
  weaknesses?

Ramadan's principal strengths are his diligence, independence and
intellectual abilities. He made my work as advisor exceptionally easy
and enjoyable. Ramadan planned the project, booked meetings, set
deadlines, etc, without me having to do anything. He had no problems
meeting the deadlines even-though I made it harder for him by modifying
the specification of his project a few times. He also has a positive
outlook and is easy to communicate with. Ramadan is an exceptionally
hard worker, and I could not recommend him more strongly.

With regard to weaknesses, the only thing I can think of is that his
basic training (e.g in Math) seemed to be a bit lacking.
