{\bf Reference for Svala Sverrisdóttir}
\bigskip

I have had the privilege of Svala's attendance in three of my courses,
namely \textit{Sets and metric spaces}, \textit{Algebra} and
\textit{Enumerative combinatorics}.  These are demanding courses aimed
at mathematics majors. The enumerative combinatorics course is
particularly challenging. It is largely about combinatorial species, a
category theory approach to combinatorics, which is usually a
postgraduate level topic.

The mathematics program at University of Iceland attracts the best
students in Iceland (about 30 per year). Most of them come from an old
fashioned elite ``Gymnasium'' called MR (Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík)
which has a strong focus on mathematics. It is difficult to stand out
in this company, which for instance includes most of the former
members of the Icelandic Math Olympiad team, yet Svala manages to do
so.  She is a truly remarkable student, she is determined, sharp,
imaginative, excellent at writing, and when it comes to marks in my
courses she has a perfect score. I am convinced that she will go on to
become an accomplished mathematician in her own right.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that Svala is one of Iceland's
finest students---a fact that is also witnessed by her receiving the Sigurður
Helgason award---and her application has my unreserved support.
