{\bf Reference for Svala Sverrisdóttir}
\bigskip

I have had the privilege of Svala's attendance in two of my courses, namely
Algebraic Structures (20??) and Enumerative Combinatorics (2021).  These
are demanding courses aimed at mathematics majors, and yet Svala received
the highest possible mark in both courses. The Enumerative Combinatorics
course is particularly challenging. It is largely about combinatorial
species, a category theory approach to combinatorics, which is usually a
postgraduate level topic.

Svala is a truly remarkable student, she is hard working; super sharp;
excellent at writing; well-spoken; focused. I'm convinced that she
will go on to become a very accomplished mathematician in her own
right, if she is so inclined.


I could go on, but suffice it to say that Svala is one of Iceland's
finest students---a fact that is also witnessed by her receiving the Sigurður
Helgason award---and her application has my unreserved support.
