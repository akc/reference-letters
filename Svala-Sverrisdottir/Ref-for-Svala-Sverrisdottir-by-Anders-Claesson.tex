{\bf Reference for Svala Sverrisdóttir}
\bigskip

I have had the privilege of Svala's attendance in three of my courses,
namely \textit{Sets and metric spaces}, \textit{Algebra} and
\textit{Enumerative combinatorics}.  These are demanding courses aimed
at mathematics majors. The enumerative combinatorics course is
particularly challenging. It is largely about combinatorial species, a
category theory approach to combinatorics, which is usually a
postgraduate level topic.

Svala is a truly remarkable student, she is determined, sharp,
excellent at writing, well-spoken, and when it comes to marks in my
courses, she has a perfect score. I am convinced that she will go on
to become an accomplished mathematician in her own right, if she is so
inclined.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that Svala is one of Iceland's
finest students---a fact that is also witnessed by her receiving the Sigurður
Helgason award---and her application has my unreserved support.
