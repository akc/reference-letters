{\bf Reference for Svala Sverrisdóttir}
\bigskip

I have had the privilege of Svala's attendance in three of my courses,
namely \textit{Sets and metric spaces}, \textit{Algebra} and
\textit{Enumerative combinatorics}.  These are demanding courses aimed
at mathematics majors. The enumerative combinatorics course is
particularly challenging. It is largely about combinatorial species, a
category theory approach to combinatorics, which is usually a
postgraduate level topic.

The mathematics program at University of Iceland attracts the best
students in Iceland (about 30 per year). Most of them come from an old
fashioned elite ``Gymnasium'' called MR (Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík)
which has a strong focus on mathematics. It is difficult to stand out in
this company, which for instance includes most of the former members of
the Icelandic Math Olympiad team, yet Svala manages to do so.  She is a
truly remarkable student, she is determined, sharp, imaginative,
excellent at writing, and when it comes to marks in my courses she has a
perfect score. I am convinced that she will go on to become an
accomplished mathematician in her own right. I could go on, but suffice
it to say that Svala is one of Iceland's finest students---a fact that
is also witnessed by her receiving the Sigurður Helgason award.

Svala has updated me on her progress after graduating from the
University of Iceland. She spent last summer at MPI-MiS in Leipzig
under the auspices of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
program. Her research there has resulted in a preprint, with Bernd
Sturmfels (Berkeley) and Laurent Manivel (Toulouse), on the topic of
four-dimensional Lie algebras. Svala is at an early stage of her
research career, but she has already shown great research potential and
this only strengthens my conviction that she will go on to become an
accomplished mathematician. Her application has my unreserved support.
