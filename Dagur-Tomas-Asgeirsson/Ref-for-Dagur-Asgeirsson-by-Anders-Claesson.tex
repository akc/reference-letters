{\bf Reference for Dagur Tómas Ásgeirsson}
\bigskip

I've known Dagur since 2016 and I've had the privilege of his attendance
in three courses: Algebra I (group and ring theory), Algebra II (module
theory), and Algebra III (Galois theory). These are demanding courses
aimed at mathematics majors.

Dagur is truly remarkable student: he is hard working; super sharp;
excellent at writing; well-spoken; focused; and when it comes to marks
in my courses, he has a perfect score. I'm convinced that he will go on
to become a very accomplished mathematician in his own right, if he is
so inclined.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that Dagur is one of Iceland's
finest students and his application has my unreserved support.
