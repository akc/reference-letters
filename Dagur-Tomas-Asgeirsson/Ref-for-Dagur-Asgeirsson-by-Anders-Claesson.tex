{\bf Reference for Dagur Tómas Ásgeirsson}
\bigskip

Dagur has taken three courses for me
Algebra I (group and ring theory), Algebra II (module theory), and
Algebra III (Galois theory).

These are demanding courses aimed at mathematics majors. Dagur has
consistently performed at the very top. He has a nearly perfect score.

I don't feel there's any limit to what Dagur can do.

It's been a great pleasure to have Dagur as a student. His application
has my unreserved support.
