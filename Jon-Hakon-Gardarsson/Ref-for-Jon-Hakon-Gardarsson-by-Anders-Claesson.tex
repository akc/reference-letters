{\bf Reference for Jón Hákon Garðarsson}
\bigskip

I got to know Jón Hákon when he took my second-year
algebra course on group and ring theory. His performance was excellent,
showing a level of maturity and research potential that is unusual for an
undergraduate student. Jón Hákon also completed a project with me on category
theory and adjoint functors, writing a strong report and delivering a
clear presentation of his work.

Jón Hákon's burning interest in mathematics and me believing in his
capacity for research prompted me to make an application to the
Icelandic research council (Rannís); it was for employing Jón Hákon as a
research assistant during the summer of 2023 (three month).  This
application was ultimately rejected by Rannís, but I believe it shows
something about Jón Hákon that I was willing take the time to write
the application and that I committed part my research time to
supervising him.

I would also like to add that Jón Hákon has served as student
representative on some of the meetings of the Mathematics department at
the University of Iceland, and that his input to those meetings has been
appreciated by the staff.
