{\bf Reference for Jón Hákon Garðarsson}
\bigskip

I've known Jón Hákon for a couple of years, mainly from
my Algebra course, a group and ring theory course
aimed at second year students. His performance in the course was
excellent and he demonstrated a degree of maturity and research
potential that is rare to see at such an early stage.

Jón Hákon's burning interest in mathematics and me believing in his
capacity for research prompted me to make an application to the
Icelandic research council (Rannís); it was for employing Jón Hákon as a
research assistant during the summer of 2023 (three month).  This
application was ultimately rejected by Rannís, but I believe it shows
something about Jón Hákon that I was willing take the time to write
the application and that I committed part my precious research time to
supervising him.

I would also like to add that Jón Hákon has served as student
representative on some of the meetings of the Mathematics department at
the University of Iceland, and that his input to those meetings has been
appreciated by the staff.
