{\large Reference for Bjarki Gunnarsson}
\bigskip

I've known Bjarki since 2019 when he took my {\em Algebra} course on
group and ring theory. Bjarki also completed a research-oriented BS
project in combinatorics with me. As part of that project, he
implemented the Goulden--Jackson cluster method (in Haskell), as well as a
pattern-rewriting system (resembling term-rewriting).

Bjarki recently completed a master's thesis, ``Concurrent Monads in a
2-Category,'' supervised by Tarmo Uustalu at Reykjavik University (and
co-supervised by myself). In his thesis, Bjarki formalized concurrent
monads in the theorem prover Agda and explored putting them in a
2-categorical setting. It's impressive how quickly Bjarki has become
fluent in category theory and something of an expert in formal proofs
in Agda through this work. This kind of rapid progress suggests a
strong capacity for research.

Bjarki was also an appreciated teaching assistant on a cryptocurrency
course.

The mathematics program at the University of Iceland attracts the best
students in Iceland (about 30 per year). Most of them come from an
old-fashioned ``Gymnasium'' called MR (Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík)
which has a strong focus on mathematics. This includes most of the
former members of the Icelandic Math Olympiad team. While Bjarki may
not be as mathematically gifted as the very best students I've
met at the University of Iceland, he is hard-working, he has a love for
mathematics and computer science, and he has the drive.  In sum,
Bjarki has my support and I believe he will do well in whatever he
sets out to accomplish.
