{\bf Reference for Bjarki Gunnarsson}
\bigskip

I've known Bjarki since 2019 when he took my {\em Algebra} course on
group and ring theory. Bjarki also completed a research-oriented BS
project in combinatorics with me. As part of that project, he
implemented the Goulden--Jackson cluster method in Sage, as well as a
pattern-rewriting system (resembling term-rewriting). This work
demonstrated both his mathematical understanding and his programming
ability.

Bjarki recently completed an MS thesis, ``Concurrent Monads in a
2-Category,'' supervised by Tarmo Uustalu. In this thesis Bjarki
formalized concurrent monads in the theorem prover Agda and explored
putting them in a 2-categorical setting. It's impressive how quickly
Bjarki has become fluent in category theory and an expert in formal
proofs in Agda through this work. This kind of rapid progress in
abstract areas suggests a strong capacity for research.

Bjarki was also an appreciated teaching assistant on a cryptocurrency
course, where he was responsible for tutorials and helping students with
course material.

In sum, Bjarki has my support and I believe he will do well in whatever
he sets out to accomplish.
