I've known Bjarki since 2019 when he took my Algebra course.

Courses with me: 

Bjarki also did a research oriented combinatorics BS project with me.

As part of his BS project, Bjarki implemented the Goulden-Jackson
cluster method in Sage. He also implement a pattern-rewriting system
(resembles term-rewriting).

It's impressive how Bjarki has become fluent in Category Theory and an
expert in formal proofs in Agda in such a short time.

Bjarki was an appreciated teaching assistant on a crypto currency course.
