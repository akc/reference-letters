{\bf Reference for Hjalti Þór Ísleifsson}
\bigskip

I've known Hjalti since 2016 and I've had the privilege of his attendance
in four courses: Algebra I (group and ring theory), Algebra II (module
theory), Algebra III (Galois theory), and Enumerative Combinatorics.
These are demanding courses aimed at mathematics majors.

Hjalti is a truly remarkable student, he is hard working; super sharp;
excellent at writing; well-spoken; focused; and when it comes to marks
in my courses, he has a perfect score. I'm convinced that he will go on
to become a very accomplished mathematician in his own right, if he is
so inclined.

Hjalti has also served as student representative on the meetings of the
Mathematics department at the University of Iceland, and his input to
those meetings has been very constructive and appreciated by the staff.

Hjalti is currently assisting me on the Algebra I course. He is
responsible for tutorials and marking of assignments. As always, he
has accomplished his tasks at the highest standard, and the midterm
student course evaluations give him due praise.

I could go on, but suffice it to say that Hjalti is one of Iceland's
finest students---a fact that is also witnessed by him receiving the Sigurður
Helgason award---and his application has my unreserved support.
