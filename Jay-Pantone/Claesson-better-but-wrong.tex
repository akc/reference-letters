Dear Jay,\\[-0.5ex]

I want to express my enthusiastic support your NSF proposal ``The
Tilescope Project''. I am eager to continue our collaboration on these
interesting ideas.

I am particularly looking forward to developing transfer tools to
enumerate permutation classes as well as exploring the possibility of a
transfer tool that can turn a proof tree into a dependently typed
program which when type checked would constitute a formal proof of the
correctness of the proof tree.

During the time-frame of your grant, I will work with a PhD student at
the University of Iceland on the development of a self-generating
database of generating functions (it can be see as a mechanized
companion to the OEIS) that should be helpful in producing conjectures
regarding the enumeration of permutation classes.

Yours sincerely,\medskip\\
