In "Preimages under the bubblesort operator" (Mathilde Bouvel, Lapo
Cioni, Luca Ferrari) you say

"Our focus in the present work is on the bubblesort operator, B, which
corresponds to one pass of the bubblesort algorithm. Although not
strictly speaking a sorting procedure associated with a particular
device, B shares some features with such procedures, as demonstrated in
[1]."

It's not true that B isn't associated with a sorting device. It's
exactly sorting with a stack of depth 2. Indeed, considering a stack of
depth d could be an interesting generalization to consider.
