{\bf In support of Lapo Cioni's application}
\bigskip
\bigskip

I don't know Lapo personally, but I do know his work; I am an examiner
of Lapo's PhD thesis. His research subject sits in the intersection of
computer science and mathematics. It's about sorting using primitive
devices, or data-structures, and it's about the structure of classes of
permutations.

One question that is central in Lapo's work is the following. If
$\Class$ is a (pattern) \emph{class}---i.e.\ a downwards closed set of
permutations in the containment order---and $T$ is a sorting operator,
then what is the set $T^{-1}(\Class)$. In other words, what is the set
$\{\pi : T(\pi)\in \Class\}$ of permutations that are in $\Class$ after
one application of $T$. Typically $T$ is one of $\B$ (bubble-sort), $\S$
(stack-sort) or $\Q$ (queue-sort). Also, $\Class$ is of the form
$\Av(P)$, the set of permutations avoiding the patterns in
$P$. Note that the permutations sortable by $T$ is
$T^{-1}(\Av(12))$.

Studying preimages is one of the main avenues for understanding sorting
operators. In particular, they elucidate compositions of sorting
operators: If $T$ and $U$ are sorting operators, then the permutations
sortable by $T\circ U$ are
$(T\circ U)^{-1}(\Av(21)) = U^{-1}(T^{-1}(\Av(21)))$. For instance,
Knuth observed that $\unS(\Av(21)) = \Av(231)$. Consequently, the set
$(\S^2)^{-1}(\Av(21))$ of permutations sortable by two passes through a
stack is $\unS(\Av(231))$. Similarly, the permutations sortable by
$\S\circ \B$ are $\unB(\Av(231))$, and the permutations sortable by
$\B\circ \S$ are $\unS(\Av(231, 321))$.


Lapo is obviously a very talented young mathematician. I strongly support
his application.

Yours sincerely,\medskip\\
