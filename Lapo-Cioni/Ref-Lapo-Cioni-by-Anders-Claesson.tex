{\bf In support of Lapo Cioni's application}
\bigskip
\bigskip

I don't know Lapo personally, but I do know his work; I am an examiner
of Lapo's PhD thesis. His research subject sits in the intersection of
computer science and mathematics. It's about sorting using primitive
devices, or data-structures, and it's about the structure of permutation
classes.



He is obviously a very talented young mathematician. I strongly support
his application.

Yours sincerely,\medskip\\
