{\bf Reference for Christian Bean}
\bigskip

I've been Christian's second PhD advisor since the autumn of 2014.
Christian and I have a joint paper, with Henning Ulfarsson, published in
the Journal of Integer Sequences. It's on permutations simultaneously
avoiding a vincular and a covincular pattern. Christian took the lead on
this joint research project, which turned out to be quite a bit more
demanding than we first thought. ``Problems worthy of attack prove their
worth by fighting back'' as Danish mathematician Piet Hein once quipped.

Since then Christian has coauthored a couple more papers/preprints, but
his main contribution has been to the Tilescope/ATRAP project. This is a
novel effort to make automatic many of the techniques used in studying
permutation patterns. It's an extensive project that is partly financed
by Rannís (The Icelandic Centre for Research)
and it's principal investigator is Henning Ulfarsson. This
highly non-trivial work involves understanding and formalizing
techniques, often used in an ad hoc manner, in the literature, and then
implementing those techniques in software.

When I first met Christian he was a good programmer and a solid
mathematician even though a bit sloppy with details at times.  He has
since developed his skills very rapidly and is now an expert programmer
as well as an expert in Enumerative Combinatorics.  He has also learned
the hard way (e.g. through programming and debugging) to be a lot more
careful with the details.

Christian is the main developer and maintainer of Tilescope/ATRAP. This
program can already produce results (automatically), with proofs, that a
large number of papers have been written on. It has also produced
results that are truly original and not yet in the literature.  I expect
it to have a big impact on the research field of permutation patterns in
the future.

Christian has great presentation skills and he has presented his work
at several local research seminars as well as international conferences
(I've attended at least four of his talks).  He's been very helpful
in supervising bachelor and master students projects. Further, Christian
has taught three full undergraduate courses by himself.

It's been a great pleasure to work with Christian and see him develop
into a skilled and independent researcher. His application for the
Bowring Research Fellowship at St Catharine's College Cambridge has my
support.
