{\bf Reference for Christian Bean}
\bigskip

I've been Christian's second PhD advisor since the autumn of 2014. With
Henning Ulfarsson, Christian and I have a joint paper, published in the
Journal of Integer Sequences, on permutations simultaneously avoiding a
vincular and a covincular pattern. This falls under the heading of
bivincular permutation patterns, a subject which I
co-pioneered. Christian took the lead on this joint research project and
did most of the, often demanding, work.

Since then Christian has coauthored a couple of papers/preprints, but
his main contribution has been to the Tilescope/ATRAP project. This is
a novel effort to make automatic many of the techniques used in studying
permutation patterns. It's a project partly financed by Rannís (The
Icelandic Centre for Research) and it's principal investigator is
Henning Ulfarsson. This is highly non-trivial work that involves
understanding and formalizing techniques, often used in an ad hoc
manner, in the literature, and then implementing those techniques in
software.

When I first met Christian he was a good programmer. He has since
developed his skills very rapidly and is now an expert programmer, and
he's the main developer and maintainer of Tilescope/ATRAP. This program
can already produce results (automatically) that many papers have been
written on. It has also produced results that are truly original and
not yet in the literature. I expect it to have a big impact on the
research field of permutation patterns in the future.

Christian has great presentation skills, and he has presented his work
at several local research seminars as well as international conferences
(I've attended at least four of his talks).  He's been very helpful
in supervising bachelor and master students projects. Further, Christian
has taught three full undergraduate courses by himself.

It's been a great pleasure to work with Christian and see him develop
into a highly skilled and independent researcher. His application for
the William Gordon Seggie Brown Research Fellowship in the Mathematical
Sciences has my full support.
