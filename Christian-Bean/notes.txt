Henning suggested I give some things that would be good to be
highlighted to make it as easy possible for you:

- our paper on vincular covincular at jis
- programming skills
- presentation skills for example mentioning pp and bcc
- I would like to emphasise the possibility of supervising too
- I have taught three full undergrad courses by myself, and a fourth in the spring

================================================================================

By that I mean, I think some of my future projects could be suited to
bachelor and graduate student projects and I would like to be able to
supervise those projects. I have plenty experience with that, having
co-supervised three bachelor projects with Henning and I am heavily
involved in all of Henning's masters students projects too.
