{\bf Recommendation for Murray Tannock}\hfill 4 August 2016
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip

I've known Murray since the spring of 2015 when he started working on
his M.Sc.\ under the supervision of Henning Ulfarsson at Reykjavik
University, and I was one of two opponents when Murray successfully
defended his M.Sc.\ thesis in late May this year. I'm currently involved
in a project with Murray, Henning and Christian Bean regarding a new
approach to enumerating (some sub-classes of) 4231-avoiding
permutations.

Murray has already produced one research paper (with coathors) on
``Pattern avoiding permutations and independent sets in graphs''.  I'm
confident that another paper can be distilled from his thesis work. This
is quite impressive at this early stage in his career. In addition to
being a talented mathematician Murray is also an expert programmer.

Murray has given talks at three conferences: Permutation Patterns 2015
and 2016, and the British Combinatorial Conference 2015. I was in
the audience for two of these talks and both were well delivered and
well received.

Murray has an undergraduate degree (B.Sc.) from University of
St~Andrews (2010--2014). I lectured at the University of Strathclyde
(Glasgow) from 2011 to 2015. During those 5 years I didn't meet any
undergraduate student of Murray's calibre. When making this comparison
one should keep in mind that I was at a computer science department
(rather than a mathematics department) and that Strathclyde is ranked a bit
lower than St Andrews, but I still think that this reflects very well on
Murray's abilities and potential.

My experience of interacting with Murray could hardly be more positive.
He has a likable personality and a good sense of humor, he is an
intelligent and independent worker, a talented young mathematician and
computer scientist. I strongly support his application.
